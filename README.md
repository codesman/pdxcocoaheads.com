# Contributing

If you'd like to add features, fix typos on the site or implement one of our [issues](https://github.com/pdx-cocoaheads/pdxcocoaheads.com/issues); Pull requests are welcome! Read on for how to get the project set up to build locally.

## Building the app

The site is built using [Vapor](https://vapor.codes), check out their [documentation](http://docs.vapor.codes) to find out how to do things within the framework.

### Command Line

If you have the [Vapor Toolbox](https://github.com/vapor/toolbox) installed, run `vapor build` and `vapor run`. More info in the [Toolbox Documentation](https://vapor.github.io/documentation/getting-started/install-toolbox.html)

Otherwise, run `swift build` to compile the application, then run `.build/debug/App`.

Once the app is running open a browser and head to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)!

### Xcode 8

If you want to use Xcode you'll need to create and maintain your own Xcode Project file (it is in the .gitignore). [Vapor Toolbox](https://github.com/vapor/toolbox) has a handy command to generate one for you: `vapor xcode`. Once you've done that, you can open the project in Xcode and choose the "App" target and build/run/debug from Xcode.

Open a browser and head to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)!
